## Assignment Problems
- Stable Marriage Problem <br>
<pre>   The problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of 
   preferences for each element.
</pre>

- Stable Roommates Problem<br>
<pre>  The problem of finding a stable matching for an even-sized set. This is distinct from the stable-marriage 
  problem in that the stable-roommates problem allows matches between any two elements, not just between classes
  of "men" and "women".
